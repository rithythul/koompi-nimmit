## Global Agent Rules

1. **Resolve IDs first.** When a user refers to a product/category/brand by name, always run a search or list query to get the `id` before mutating.
2. **Price = String.** All monetary values (`price`, `amount`, `unitPrice`) are passed as `String` in GraphQL to preserve decimal precision.
3. **shopId is always required.** Every query/mutation requires `shopId`. Resolve it once at the start of a conversation via `ownedShops` or `joinedShops`.
4. **Pagination.** List queries return `{ data, limit, skip, totalPages, totalDocuments }`. Default to `limit: 20, page: 1`.
5. **Soft delete.** Products are archived (`productSetArchived`), not hard-deleted. Use `productDelete` only when the user explicitly says "permanently delete."

### ⚠️ Destructive Operations — ALWAYS Require Confirmation

**NEVER execute any of these mutations without explicit user confirmation first.**
Show a summary of what will be affected, then ask "Are you sure? Reply Yes to confirm" or send a Telegram inline button.

| `deleteSubcategory` | Deletes a subcategory | catalog/categories.md |
| `deleteBrand` | Deletes a brand (products lose brand) | catalog/brands.md |
| `setOrderStatus(CANCELLED)` | Cancels an order (triggers stock reversal) | orders/lifecycle.md |
